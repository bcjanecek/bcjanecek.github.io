## Sagemaker
AWS Sagemaker is the heart of machine learning in AWS and is intended to handle the entire machine learning workflow from building, training, and deploying to production. Features ranges from offering Sagemaker notebooks for data preparation and feature engineering to spinning up EC2 instances to train models on large datasets. 

The root of the general architecture of Sagemaker is training data sitting in an S3 bucket. The job of Sagemaker is to provision hosts to train that data on. The model itself comes from a Docker image in an Elastic Container Registry (ECR).
